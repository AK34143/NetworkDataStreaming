This project contains 3 java classes:
1) BloomFilter.java that implements Bloom Filter
2) CountingBloomFilter.java that implements Counting Bloom Filter
3) CodedBloomFilter.java that implements Coded Bloom Filter. 

I have added a Helper class that generates array with random numbers for a given size of the array.

The folder "out" contains all the output files
1) bloomFilter_output.txt
2) countingBloomFilter_output.txt
